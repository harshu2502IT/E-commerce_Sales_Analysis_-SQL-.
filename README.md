# E-commerce dataset for SQL analysis

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Ecommerce Dataset Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `SALES`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL and data analysis skills using a real-world style E-commerce dataset. It focuses on simulating tasks that a data analyst would typically perform when working with online retail data.

The project involves:

Setting up an E-commerce database from raw CSV data

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Writing SQL queries to answer specific business questions (sales trends, top products, customer insights, payment preferences, etc.)

Applying data cleaning and transformation techniques where required

This project is ideal for beginner to intermediate data analysts who want to practice SQL and EDA techniques, and it serves as a strong portfolio project to showcase SQL proficiency.

## Objectives  

1. **Set up an E-commerce database**: Create and populate an E-commerce sales database with the provided dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Detect and handle missing, inconsistent, or duplicate records to ensure data quality.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis using SQL and Python to uncover patterns in customer behavior, sales, and product performance.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `SALES`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `ecommerce_dataset_10000` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for customer_id, first_name, last_name, gender, age_group, signup_date, country, product_id, product_name, category, quantity, unit_price, order_id, order_date, order_status, payment_method, rating,review_text.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SALES;

CREATE TABLE ECOMMERCE_DATASET_10000 (
    gender TEXT,
    age_group TEXT,
    signup_date DATE,
    country TEXT,
    product_id VARCHAR(50),
    product_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    quantity INT,
    unit_price INT,
    order_id VARCHAR(50),
    order_date DATE,
    order_status TEXT,
    payment_method TEXT,
    rating INT,
    review_text TEXT
);

```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ECOMMERCE_DATASET_10000
WHERE customer_id IS NULL
OR	
first_name IS NULL
OR	
last_name IS NULL
